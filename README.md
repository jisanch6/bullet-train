# bullet-train
This will be the webpage for the API that I am developing for an application taking in mind the bullet train that will be built from Houston to Dallas. The purpose of this webpage is to show my understanding of HTML, CSS and SCSS. All information is loaded statically and only serves the purpose of being design for a web application which I will use to automatically populate the departures, reviews, and have user access functionalities.

To look at the web application code, please go to bullet-train-NodeApp.
